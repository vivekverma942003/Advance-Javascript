IIFE :-Immediately Invokes Function Execution 
This is the function gets executed when it is defined it always created inside a parenthesis and called after there.
The main goal of this function is to reduce the disturbances from the outer variable 

(()=>{
    console.log("This is the arrow iife function")
})();
*******************************************Important*********************
It is very important to use semicolon when you are using two iife functions 
(function name(){
    console.log("This is the name function");
})()
