 🎖️🎖️Debounce :-Debouncing is a technique that delays the execution of a function until a certain amount of time
               has passed since the last event's occurrence. It's useful when you want the function to be called 
               after a period  of inactivity, and it prevents rapid consecutive calls.

   🎖️🎖️:-    In debouncing, the function is only executed after a specific delay since the last event's occurrence. 
              If new events occur within the delay period, the timer is reset, and the function execution is further delayed.
   🧑‍💻🧑‍💻Use Cases:-
            Search Input: Avoid making API calls on every keystroke.
            Window Resize: Improve performance by limiting the number of resize calculations.
            Button Click: Prevent accidental multiple submissions.
    

  🎖️🎖️ Throttle:-
         Throttling and debouncing are techniques used to control the rate at which a function is invoked, particularly in scenarios where frequent events
         (like user interactions) can lead to excessive calls and potentially impact performance.
         In throttling, the function is executed at a fixed interval. Even if the triggering event occurs more frequently, the function is invoked according
         to the defined interval.
  🧑‍💻🧑‍💻 Use Cases:
                 Scroll Events
                 Windwo Resize
